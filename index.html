              On 23rd March,1931 freedom fighters Bhagat Singh along with
              Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar were hanged to Death. The legacy is still
              remained in the heart of Indians that keeps us all inspired for
              ever. They were the ones who fought against British for freedom of
              India at very young age and their sacrifice was an important
              catalyst for India’s Independence. That is what makes them
              #Realheroes of our nation. Let us all take a moment to appreciate
              them and remember those because of whom we are free today.

              When the British Govt implemented an act to suppress freedom
              struggle, it gave the British Police a free hand to carry out
              arrests without any permissions. In order to protest against this
              act, Bhagat Singh and his friends carried out a plan to use low
              intensity bomb inside the assembly hall and at the same time
              ensure that there are no deaths. Immediately after the bombing,
              Bhagat Singh and his friends voluntarily surrendered and taken to
              trial. They were charged with attempt to murder and sentenced to
              14 years life in 1929. Further investigation by the Police led to
              discovery of other members, some of who turned into informants and
              helped police to connect Bhagat Singh with an alleged murder of a
              British Officer. Singh was again arrested and sent to another jail
              where he faced discrimination between British & Indian prisoners
              and that led to his protest in the form of huger strike against
              the discrimination. In the meantime, the ongoing investigation of
              framing Bhagat Singh for the alleged murder of a British Officer
              in the past was hastened by the Viceroy, Irwin in 1930. Bhagat
              Singh, Rajguru & Sukhdev were sentenced to death and the execution
              date was fixed to 24th March 1931. The Congress and Gandhi made
              some attempts to save the lives but went in vain. Gandhi finally
              came to an agreement in the Gandhi-Irwin pact which gave the
              British the go-ahead with execution of Bhagat Singh and his
              friends. On 17th March, a telegram was sent to Home Dept preponing
              the execution date to 23rd March, and was hanged to death at
              7.30pm on 23rd March 1931.
